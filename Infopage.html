        <p>Elephant Falls is located in Shillong, Meghalaya. It's a stunning cascade with three tiers of falls.The first fall of Elephant Falls is an example of a horsetail-punchbowl waterfall. The first fall is very broad and is hidden among trees. The second fall however, is quite domesticated and in the winters (and drier months) looks inconsequential. The third fall is the tallest and comes to view suddenly and looks most spectacular with crystal clear water falling over sharp rocks of myriad shapes.
            The sides of the waterfall are flanked by lush greenery and are rich in ferns.</p>

        <p>Dudhsagar Waterfalls is one of the tallest waterfalls in India, located on the Mandovi River in GoaThere are two routes to reach there. One is starting the trek from Kulem and following the jeep trail until the bottom of the waterfall. The second option is via the railway track which is roughly around 11 km. This trek is not allowed by the Government of Goa ( Forest Department) as it is very risky being on a railway track with minimum safety. Anyone trekking along the Railway trek can be heavily fined and can even land you in Jail as the same is now an offence under the Railway regulations. You can trek up to the Sonaulim station and join back to the Mud route. This route would save 2 km on the Mud road. During the monsoon season, it is mandatory to hire a guide and get a life jacket in order to start the trek, otherwise, entry inside the forest is restricted because the area experiences extremely heavy rainfall, and the water displacement around the fall is potentially very large, so it is always better to carry a life jacket. It is advisable not to venture into the water at the base of the fall during monsoon as the flow of the water is very fast & dangerous.</p>
